# ðŸŽ® Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is about training agents to make sequences of decisions by interacting with an environment.

## ðŸŒŸ Goals

- Understand the RL framework: agents, environments, states, actions, rewards
- Implement key algorithms like Q-learning, REINFORCE, and PPO
- Visualize learning over time and debug agent behavior
- Compare performance across environments

## ðŸ“‚ Subsections

| Subfolder               | Description |

| `value_based_methods`   | Learn value functions, value iteration, Q-learning |
| `policy_based_methods`  | Direct policy optimization methods like REINFORCE |
| `deep_rl`               | Deep Q-Networks, DDPG, PPO using neural networks |
| `environments`          | GridWorld, OpenAI Gym, and custom RL environments |
