# üß† Machine Learning Journey

Welcome to my Machine Learning GitHub repository ‚Äî a living, growing notebook where I document my hands-on learning across the machine learning landscape. Whether it's linear models or deep reinforcement learning, this repo serves as both a **learning companion** and a **knowledge hub**. üå±

## üîç Why this Repository?

I wanted to:

- Learn machine learning in a structured, topic-wise manner
- Reinforce concepts with experiments, notes, and mini-projects
- Make it easy for others (and future me!) to follow along

Each topic contains:

- üìù A `README.md` to explain the concept
- üìì Jupyter notebooks with implementations
- ‚úÖ Checklists to track progress
- üß† Reflections, notes, and resources

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

To run the notebooks locally, you can use either `venv` or `conda`. Below are the recommended steps for **macOS** using Conda.

### üçè Setup Using Conda (macOS)

1. **Create a new Conda environment**

   ```bash
   conda create -n ml python=3.10
   ```

2. Activate the environment:

   ```bash
   conda activate ml
   ```

3. Install packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Add the environment as Jupyter Kernel:

   ```bash
   python -m ipykernel install --user --name=ml --display-name="ml"
   ```

5. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

Now you can select the "Python (ml-env)" kernel to run the notebooks.
